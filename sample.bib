The most common position currently used in the United States is prone. This recommendation is made with the full recognition that the existing studies have methodologic limitations and were conducted in countries with infant care practices and other SIDS risk factors that differ from those in the United States (eg, maternal smoking, types of bedding, central heating, etc). However, taken as a group the studies are convincing. No reports show an advantage to the prone position with regard to SIDS incidence and there are no data proving, or even strongly suggesting, that sleeping in the lateral or supine position is harmful to healthy infants. Thus, assessment of the risk/benefit balance for prone vs nonprone positioning for such infants favors the latter. It should be stressed that, the actual risk of SIDS for an infant placed prone is still extremely low. There are still good reasons for placing certain infants prone. For premature infants with respiratory distress, for infants with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux or with certain upper airway anomalies, and perhaps for some others, prone may well be the position of choice. A nonprone sleeping position is recommended for healthy infants only. REPORT Health care professionals frequently are asked how it is best to place an infant down for sleep, prone or supine.},

Simultaneously, the SIDS rate in the United States has also dropped. New data also suggest that the supine position confers the lowest risk; however, the side position is still significantly safer than the prone position.

Although the SIDS rate continues to fall, some of the recent decrease of the last several years may be a result of coding shifts to other causes of unexpected infant deaths. Since the AAP published its last statement on SIDS in 2000, several issues have become relevant, including the significant risk of side sleeping position; the AAP no longer recognizes side sleeping as a reasonable alternative to fully supine sleeping. The AAP also stresses the need to avoid redundant soft bedding and soft objects in the infant{\textquoteright}s sleeping environment, the hazards of adults sleeping with an infant in the same bed, the SIDS risk reduction associated with having infants sleep in the same room as adults and with using pacifiers at the time of sleep, the importance of educating secondary caregivers and neonatology practitioners on the importance of {\textquotedblleft}back to sleep,{\textquotedblright} and strategies to reduce the incidence of positional plagiocephaly associated with supine positioning. This statement reviews the evidence associated with these and other SIDS-related issues and proposes new recommendations for further reducing SIDS risk.},
